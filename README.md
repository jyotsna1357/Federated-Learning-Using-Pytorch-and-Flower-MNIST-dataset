# Federated-Learning-Using-Pytorch-and-Flower-MNIST-dataset
This repository implements a Federated Learning framework using PyTorch and Flower, focusing on the MNIST handwritten digit classification dataset. It demonstrates how to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in a federated manner, allowing multiple clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their raw data.
